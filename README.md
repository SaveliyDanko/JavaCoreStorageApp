# Java Application README

## Overview

This Java application is designed to provide robust storage and manipulation of user objects, utilizing an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) approach. It is a multi-threaded, multi-user client-server application built with a focus on performance, scalability, and maintainability. The application leverages PostgreSQL for data storage and offers comprehensive logging capabilities. Below, you'll find detailed information about the technologies and features used in this project.

## Features

### Multi-threading
The application utilizes multi-threading to enhance performance and responsiveness. Multiple threads handle concurrent user requests, ensuring efficient processing and reducing latency.

### Multi-user Support
Designed to support multiple users simultaneously, the application manages concurrent access and operations on the database securely and efficiently.

### PostgreSQL Database
PostgreSQL is used as the database management system. It ensures reliable, scalable, and high-performance data storage, supporting complex queries and transactions.

### Logging
Robust logging mechanisms are in place to track application activity, errors, and debug information. This helps in monitoring application performance and troubleshooting issues effectively.

### Client-Server Architecture
The application follows a client-server architecture. The server handles requests from multiple clients, processes them, and communicates results back to the clients.

### Networking with Sockets
The application uses Java's networking capabilities, including Sockets, Selectors, and ServerSocket, to manage communication between clients and the server. This setup ensures efficient and reliable data transmission.

### SOLID Principles and Design Patterns
The application is designed following SOLID principles, ensuring a clean, maintainable, and flexible codebase. Various design patterns are employed to solve common problems and enhance the application's extensibility and reusability.

## Main Goal

The primary goal of this application is to provide a storage solution for user objects, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Additionally, users can apply filters and sorts to manipulate objects stored in the database efficiently.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- Network connectivity for client-server communication

### Setup
1. **Database Configuration:**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Create a database and configure the connection details in the application's configuration file.

2. **Build and Run the Server:**
   - Compile the server code using your preferred Java build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle).
   - Run the server application to start listening for client connections.

3. **Build and Run the Client:**
   - Compile the client code.
   - Run the client application and connect to the server using the appropriate network address.

### Operations
- **CRUD Operations:** Users can create, read, update, and delete objects in the database.
- **Filtering and Sorting:** Users can apply various filters and sort criteria to query objects from the database.

### Logging
- Logs are generated for all major operations and errors.
- Log files are stored in a specified directory for review and analysis.
